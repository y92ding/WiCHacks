# Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is Codeversation?
	- Codeversation is a website that uses basic face and voice recognition in order to teach someone how to code. We have made it so that they can say something into their computer microphone, and it will generate an answer to a statement or question. Also if the answer seems as though it was not explained thoroughly, facial recogniton will also pick up the certain features of a confused or puzzled face and then explain in a different way. The user will interact with the advatar created in order for them to learn. This experience will allow for the conversational aspect missing from other similar sites.

3. Why Did We Create Codeversation?
	- We created codeversation becasue we felt as though it was an innovative way to teach anyone to code. We have come to the understanding that things are moving forward in a quick pace towards the highway of technology. The creation of Codeversation was mainly to teach people how to code through conversation, and with the addition to a source that responds to you almost as if you were learning a verbal language. A responding source provides a much better experience and offers an easier way to learn for the users.

4. How Does This Benefit Users?
	- Our users will get an interactive experience from Codeversation. They learn that coding is not as hard as it is said to be. It helps anyone learn to code by giving detailed explanations. If the user still looks or states that they are confused, then the responding source explains it in a different way.
